A Java enterprise webshop application.

User Interaction:
Users interact with the application via the UI

Servlets:
The servlets handle incoming requests from the UI. They act as controllers forwarding requests to appropriate handlers.

Handlers (Facade Layer):
Servlets call methods in handlers, which encapsulate business logic. Handlers act as a facade, abstracting the underlying complexity of models and database access. This separation ensures that the servlets remain lightweight and focused on controlling the flow.

Models (Business Objects):
Handlers interact with models (such as User, Item, Order). These models represent the core business objects and contain data and logic relevant to the application's domain.

Database Access:
Models use DB classes to interact with the database. The DB classes use database operations (CRUD) and manage database connections through DBManager, for a clean separation between business logic and data persistence.

Response Back to UI:
Once the data is processed, the handlers return results to the servlets, which then forward the response back to the UI, presenting the result to the user.
